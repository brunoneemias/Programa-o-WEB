			<h3>1. Indica </h3>
			<p> The origin is believed to come from the Hindu “Kush” region close to Afghanistan. Anyone who knows anything about marijuana knows 
			that Kush is really strong weed. In this area of Afghanistan, the strain developed thick coats of resin as a mean of protecting themselves
			due to the harsh climate.</br> Characteristics of Indica include flowering time, yields, geography of where seeds came from and various flavors. 
			Some of the epic names given to top flavors include; Purple Haze, Granddaddy Purple and Northern Lights.</br>
		   The Indica strain is a more relaxing effect with the tendency of making you want to hang out on the couch.
